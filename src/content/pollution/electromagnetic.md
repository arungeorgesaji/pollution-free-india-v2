# How Electromagnetic Pollution Occurs?

Electromagnetic pollution, also known as electrosmog, occurs when artificial electromagnetic fields (EMFs) generated by electronic devices and wireless technologies accumulate in the environment at levels that may potentially affect living organisms. These invisible fields are produced whenever electricity is used.

Sources range from everyday household appliances to large-scale infrastructure. The proliferation of wireless technologies, power lines, and electronic devices has significantly increased our exposure to artificial EMFs in recent decades.

## Primary Sources
- Power lines and electrical wiring
- Wireless networks (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular)
- Mobile phones and communication devices
- Household appliances and electronic equipment

# How Can One Prevent It?

Reduce exposure by maintaining distance from EMF sources and limiting time spent near high-emission devices. Use wired connections instead of wireless when possible, and turn off electrical devices when not in use, especially in sleeping areas.

## Prevention Methods
- Use wired internet connections instead of Wi-Fi
- Keep electronic devices away from sleeping areas
- Choose low-EMF appliances when available
- Limit cell phone use and use speaker mode

# Measures for Affected Areas

If you're concerned about electromagnetic pollution in your environment, here are steps you can take:

1. **Measure EMF levels** in your home and workplace using an EMF meter
2. **Create low-EMF zones** in your home, particularly in bedrooms
3. **Support research** on the health effects of long-term EMF exposure
4. **Advocate for prudent deployment** of wireless infrastructure in residential areas
