# How Light Pollution Occurs?

Light pollution occurs when artificial lighting is excessive, misdirected, or intrusive, creating brightened skies that obscure the natural night environment. This form of pollution primarily affects urban and suburban areas where artificial lighting is prevalent and often poorly designed.

The main types include skyglow (brightening of the night sky over inhabited areas), glare (excessive brightness that causes visual discomfort), light trespass (light falling where it's not intended or needed), and clutter (bright, confusing groupings of light sources).

## Primary Sources
- Street lighting and architectural lighting
- Commercial and advertising signs
- Sports complexes and event venues
- Residential outdoor lighting

# How Can One Prevent It?

Use shielded lighting fixtures that direct light downward where it's needed, preventing upward light spill. Install motion sensors or timers to ensure lights are only active when necessary. Choose warm-colored LEDs with appropriate brightness levels instead of cool, bright white lights.

## Prevention Methods
- Install fully shielded outdoor lighting
- Use timers and motion sensors
- Choose appropriate brightness for needs
- Turn off unnecessary lights at night

# Measures for Affected Areas

If your area is affected by light pollution, here are steps you can take:

1. **Advocate for dark sky policies** in your community planning
2. **Retrofit existing fixtures** with shielded, dark-sky friendly alternatives
3. **Participate in citizen science projects** measuring night sky brightness
4. **Educate neighbors and businesses** about responsible lighting practices
